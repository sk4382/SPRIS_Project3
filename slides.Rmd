# Introduction 
## Background
- MATIK is a newly discovered, highly contagious viral skin disease that causes serious skin rash and infections in patients, and could even be life threatening.
- Three medications, Pill A, Gel B and Gel C, among all the biological and animal studies, appeared to be promising. 
- Phase I trials have already been conducted to determine their MTD. Researchers/clinicians conducted a crossover phase II trial.

  + Pill A: 200 mg, once a day for 4 weeks;
  + Gel B: 1\% gel concentration; three times a day on affected areas, daily use for 4 weeks;
  + Gel C: 2\% gel concentration; once a day on affected areas, daily use for 4 weeks.
  
## Objective

- Primary goal: safety and adherence profiles

  + whether the medications are safe for patients;
  + whether patients could easily adhere to medication schedules so that long term use is feasible.
  
- Secondary goal

  + assess the correlation of Pharmacokinetics with adherence measures and the occurrence of adverse events;
  + identify demographic factors associated with product adherence and whether they differ by product used (Pill or gel) or regimen (three times a day or once a day).


# Method
## Study Design
- Phase 2, multi-site, randomized, open-label, three-arm crossover study
- 180 MATIK patients were recruited from a variety of sites(but we assume no site effect in this study)
- Study participants will be randomized to one of six regimen sequences

Study Regimen of the Phase 2 randomized, three-arm crossover study
![](regime.png)

## Endpoint
- Primary endpoint measures:

  + Safety: The number of grade 2 or higher adverse events occurred during that week;
  + Adherence: The number of days (out of 7 days) that patients are able to take pills or apply gels as prescribed.

- Secondary endpoints:

  + the viral loads in the blood plasma and affected skin tissues were measured at the beginning and at the end of each period. 

## Data Description
- demographic variables: age, gender and race 
- outcome variables: adverse events, adherence, PK, Cumulative AE, Cumulative AD, change of PK(no missing values)

## Primary Analysis
- We will use mixed effects model to account for the correlation between subject

   + random effects are often used to describe the subject-specific effect - random intercept $\beta_{i0}\sim N(\beta_{0}, \tau^2)$
   + fixed effects are used to describe population-level effect, including the treatment effect, time effect, carryover effect and demographic covariate effect.
   
- Merge week outcomes because of convergence problem

  + logistic regression for safety outcome: we define 0 to be no adverse events and 1 to be having adverse events
  + poisson regression for adherence, with offset equal to 28

## Primary Analysis Model fit

- The primary covariates are defined as follows: 
\[
\begin{aligned}
& x_1(x_2) = \left\{ \begin{array}{ll}
 1 & \textrm{period2(3)}\\
 0 & \textrm{otherwise}\\
 \end{array} \right.
x_3(x_4) = \left\{ \begin{array}{ll}
 1 & \textrm{treatment B(C)}\\
 0 & \textrm{otherwise}\\
 \end{array} \right.\\
&x_5(x_6) = \left\{ \begin{array}{ll}
 1 & \textrm{seq = CAB or ACB(BCA or CBA)}\\
 0 & \textrm{otherwise}\\
 \end{array} \right.
\end{aligned}
\]

- Adverse events model:
\[
logitP(Y1_{ij}=1) = \beta_{i0}+\beta_1x_{ij1}+\beta_2x_{ij2} + \beta_3x_{ij3}+\beta_4x_{ij4} + \beta_5x_{ij5} + \beta_6x_{ij6}\,\,(1)
\]

- Adherence model:
\[
\log Y2_{ij} = \beta_{i0}+\beta_1x_{ij1}+\beta_2x_{ij2} + \beta_3x_{ij3}+\beta_4x_{ij4} + \beta_5x_{ij5} + \beta_6x_{ij6}\,\,(2)
\]
where $j=1,2,3; i=1,\cdots, n=180$.

## Primary Analysis Final Model 
For both outcome adverse events and adherence, we need to:

- First examine the carry over effect, if the cumulative carryover effect is not significantly different, we can use the whole dataset, otherwise, we can only use the first period data. 
- Let $\rho_A, \rho_B, \rho_C$ denote the carryover effect of each medication, testing $H_0: \rho_A= \rho_B=\rho_C$, which is equivalent to test $H_0: \rho_A +  \rho_B=\rho_C + \rho_A= \rho_B+\rho_C$, this is also equivalent to(multiple tests and use Bonferroni adjustment.): 
 \[
 H_0: \beta_{5} = \beta_{6} = 0 \textrm{ versus } H_1:  \textrm{at least one of them is not } 0
 \]

 - Finalize the model and do the safety and adherence analysis by evaluating the period, treatment effects.
 - Model fit checking

## Secondary Analysis-correlation

- We first assess the correlation by the traditional definition; 
- Then we built a model to assess the association between PK and corresponding adverse events and adherence  using the linear mixed effect model. 
\[
\begin{aligned}
P_{ij}
& = \beta_{i0}+\beta_1x_{ij1}+\beta_2x_{ij2} + \beta_3x_{ij3}+\beta_4x_{ij4} \\
& + \beta_7^T Z_{i} + \beta_{8}Y1_{ij} + \beta_{9}Y2_{ij}  + \epsilon_{ij}\,\,(3)
\end{aligned}
\]
where $j=1,2,3; i=1,\cdots, n=180$ and  $\epsilon_{ij} \sim N(0,\sigma^2)$. 

## Secondary Analysis-demographic effects

- Interested in identifying demographic factors associated with product adherence as well as whether they differ by drug used. 
- Created two new variables $M1=1$ indicating "gel" and $M2=1$ indicating once a day. 
- Included the demographic factors denoted by $Z$ into model (2) and also test if there is any interaction
\[
\begin{aligned}
\log Y_{ij}
& = \beta_{i0} + \beta_7^T Z_{i} + \beta_8 M1_{ij} +  \beta_9 M2_{ij} + \beta_{10}^T Z_{i}M1_{ij} +  \beta_{11}^T Z_{i} M2_{ij}\,\,(4)
\end{aligned}
\]
where $j=1,2,3; i=1,\cdots, n=180$.

## Interpretation of Safety Analysis

- carryover effect: there is no statistically significant different cumulative carryover effects among sequnces.
- period is not significant in advserse effects.
- The safety is comparable among all three mediations. 
  
  + The odds of adverse events for treatment B is 1.302(95%CI: (0.490,3.595)) times the odds for treatment A after adjusting for other covariates. 
  + The odds of adverse events for treatment C is 0.823(95%CI: (0.291,2.295)) times the odds for treatment A after adjusting for other covariates. 

- We also found age is significantly associated with the adverse events in exploratory analysis.

## Interpretation of Adherence Analysis

- carryover effect: there is no statistically significant different cumulative carryover effects among sequnces.
- period is not significant in advserse effects.
- The adherence is significantly different among all three mediations. 

  + The rate of adherence for treatment B is 0.846(95%CI: (0.811,0.883)) times the rate for treatment A after adjusting for other covariates. 
  + The rate of adherence for treatment C is 0.884(95%CI: (0.848,922)) times the rate for treatment A after adjusting for other covariates. 
  + People tend to adhere to treatment A over others.
  
<!-- After accounting for period and sequence in our Poisson regression model, we conclude: -->
<!-- \begin{itemize} -->
<!-- \item Rate of adherence for treatment B is $e^{-.167} = 0.846$ relative to treatment A -->
<!-- \item Rate of adherence for treatment C is $e^{-.123} = 0.884$ relative to treatment A -->
<!-- \item People seem to adhere to treatment A over others. -->
<!-- \end{itemize} -->

## Correlation of PK with Adherence and the AE

![](corr.png){width=60%}

- Adverse events are positively correlated to the change of PK while adherence is negatively correlated both for skin and blood.

- The decrease of PK get larger, and the probability of adverse events get smaller while the adherence will increase.
<!-- \begin{itemize} -->
<!-- \item PK and Adherence have low correlation ($\rho_{pk.skin} = -0.27$, $\rho_{pk.blood} = -0.20$) -->
<!-- \item Mean PK measures between AE = 1 and AE = 0 groups differs significantly. On average, viral load is 48.214 IU/mL and 22.814 IU/mL greater for those who experience AE, on skin and blood, respectively.  -->
<!-- \end{itemize} -->

## Model of PK associated adverse events and adherence stratified by area
In addition, we observe that PK is also significantly associated with treatment, age and gender. 

  - Pill A has better performance than Gel B, Gel C in terms of reducing the viral load in both skin and blood; 
  - younger and female patients will have larger PK decrease.

## Interpretation of Demographic Factors with Adherence analysis

- Age is the only demographic factor significantly associated with adherence in both models (Treatment and Regimen).
- Pill users adhere significantly better than gel users; Users that take treatment only once a day (Pill A, Gel C) adhere significantly better than users that must take treatment 3 times a day (Gel B).
- There exists significant interaction.

  + In the same pill or gel group, adherence rate of those who use treatment once a day is about 1.82 that of those who use treatment three times a day. 
  + In the same regimen group, adherence rate for gel users is approximately half of pill users. 

# Conclusion and Discussion

## Conclusion-Primary analysis

- No significant different cumulative carryover effect was detected. 
- The analysis results above shows that all three medications are safe. 
- Pill A has higher adherence than Gel B and Gel C. 

  + Patients has higher adherence on Pill than on Gel; 
  + Patients are more likely to be adherent if the medication is given once a day than three times a day. 
  
- In addition, older patients tent to have better adherence to treatment.

## Conclusion-Secondary analysis

- For pharmacoknetics, The decrease of PK get larger, and the probability of adverse events get smaller while the adherence will increase. 
- Pill A has better performance than Gel B, Gel C in terms of reducing the viral load in both skin and blood. 
- Younger and female patients will have larger PK decrease.

## Discussion

- Pill A is recommended for a next step Phase III trial because of better adherence and better efficacy. For the Phase III trial, a randomized, placebo-controlled, double blinded design is recommended. 
- Since we observed the significant effct of age on adherence, it is necessary to do the stratification, i.e., randomize by age stratum.
- subject recruitment and financial support.
